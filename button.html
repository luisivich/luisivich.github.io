  <h1>Trees</h1>
  <pre> I think that I shall never see
    A poem lovely as a tree.
    
    A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
    Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
    
    A tree that looks at God all day,
    And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
    
    A tree that may in Summer wear
    A nest of robins in her hair;
    
    Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
    Who intimately lives with rain.
    
    Poems are made by fools like me,
    But only God can make a tree. I think that I shall never see
    A poem lovely as a tree.
