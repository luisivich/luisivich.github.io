             <strong>S</strong>hall I compare thee to a summer's day?
            <strong>T</strong>hou art more lovely and more temperate:
            <strong>R</strong>ough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
             <strong>A</strong>nd summer’s lease hath all too short a date:
             <strong>S</strong>ometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
             <strong>A</strong>nd often is his gold complexion dimm’d,
             <strong>A</strong>nd every fair from fair sometime declines,
            <strong>B</strong>y chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
             <strong>B</strong>ut thy eternal summer shall not fade,
            <strong>N</strong>or lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
             <strong>N</strong>or shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
             <strong>W</strong>hen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
             <strong>S</strong>o long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
             <strong>S</strong>o long lives this, and this gives life to thee*
